### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Canin Carlos, a.k.a. [Culture Clap](https://www.cultureclap.com).

I'm a self-taught developer and survivor of white supremacy.

I've been coding for many years, originally started in high school creating GeoCities & Angelfire pages for my high school band; and returned to the field as I viewed it as a viable skill to earn money, and I had a project I wanted to build.

[MnActivist.Org](https//www.mnactivist.org) is that project, built around the [@OpenStates](//www.github.com/OpenStates) project.

My work is documented via the [@ScreamFreely](//www.github.com/ScreamFreely) project where I'm using @VueJS to built a wrapper around an expansion of the Open States work.
