### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Canin Carlos, a.k.a. [Culture Clap](https://www.cultureclap.com).

I'm a self-taught developer and survivor of white supremacy.

Coding since the early 2000's, originally I started in high school creating [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) & [Angelfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire) pages for my high school band; and I returned to the code near 2010, as I had a project I wanted to build. It's been a bit of a battle of attrition to participate since, but, I'm still here !!! Jaja

## Weekly Goals
- [ ] Learn and Build Docker Containers for idioke, DreamFreely, and the Activist Sites.
- [ ] Update README's for all of the projects, and clean up GitHub Profile
- [ ] Add DreamFreely Library to public GitHub and begin teaching/writing

# What I'm Building:

[MnActivist.Org](https//www.mnactivist.org) is that project, built around the [@OpenStates](//www.github.com/OpenStates) project.

My work is documented via [@ScreamFreely](//www.github.com/ScreamFreely) where I'm using [@VueJS](//www.github.com/vuejs) to built a wrapper around an expansion of the Open States project. As well I am creating *Learn to Code* curriculum via [@RebelCoding](//www.github.com/RebelCoding).

Next up is a program called [idioke Daily](//www.idioke.com). The initial program has very little tech, outside of using WhatsApp and Notion; though there is a web and phone app on deck behind the scenes :)

It's all part and parcel of the Culture Clap ethos; to bring multiple rhythms, melodies and harmonies together in creation of something of which anyone can partake.
