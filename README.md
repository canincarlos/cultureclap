### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Canin Carlos, a.k.a. [Culture Clap](https://www.cultureclap.com).

[Blog](//blog.cultureclap.com) | [LinkedIn](//linkedin.com/in/cultureclap) | [Twitter](//twitter.com/cultureclap) | [Patreon](//patreon.com/cultureclap) 

I'm a self-taught developer and survivor of white supremacy.

Coding since the early 2000's, originally I started in high school creating GeoCities & Angelfire pages for my high school band; and returned to the field near 2010, as I viewed it as a viable skill to earn money, and I had a project I wanted to build. The whole *consistently earning money from tech* has yet to pan out, but I've built some *fun to me* projects in the interim.

[MnActivist.Org](https//www.mnactivist.org) is that project, built around the [@OpenStates](//www.github.com/OpenStates) project.

My work is documented via the [@ScreamFreely](//www.github.com/ScreamFreely) project where I'm using [@VueJS](//www.github.com/vuejs) to built a wrapper around an expansion of the Open States work. While creating *Learn to Code* curriculum via [@RebelCoding](//www.github.com/RebelCoding).
