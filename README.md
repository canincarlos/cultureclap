# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Canin Carlos,** a.k.a. [Culture Clap](https://www.cultureclap.com).

I'm sincere; and that's a really bad thing in this world, I've learned.

Currently I'm building DreamFreely Labs, as well as helping a few DAOs with things.

# What I'm Building:

[DreamFreely Labs](https//www.dreamfreely.xyz) is a project that houses many other projects. One being ScreamFreely, built around the [@OpenStates](//www.github.com/OpenStates) project. As well, I am creating *Learn to Code* curriculum via [@RebelCoding](//www.github.com/RebelCoding).

Next up is a program called [idioke Daily](//www.idioke.com). The initial program has very little tech, outside of a [Telegram channel](//t.me/idioke_daily); though there is a web and phone app on deck behind the scenes :)

It's all part and parcel of the Culture Clap ethos; to bring multiple rhythms, melodies and harmonies together in creation of something of which anyone can partake.
