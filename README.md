# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Canin Carlos,** a.k.a. [Culture Clap](https://www.cultureclap.com).

I'm a self-taught, indigenous developer.

Currently I'm building DreamFreely Labs, as well as project managing for ecoDAO.

## Weekly Goals
- [ ] Learn and Build Docker Containers for idioke, DreamFreely, and the Activist Sites.
- [ ] Update README's for all of the projects, and clean up GitHub Profile
- [ ] Add DreamFreely Library to public GitHub and begin teaching/writing

# What I'm Building:

[MnActivist.Org](https//www.mnactivist.org) is that project, built around the [@OpenStates](//www.github.com/OpenStates) project. As well I am creating *Learn to Code* curriculum via [@RebelCoding](//www.github.com/RebelCoding).

Next up is a program called [idioke Daily](//www.idioke.com). The initial program has very little tech, outside of using WhatsApp and Notion; though there is a web and phone app on deck behind the scenes :)

It's all part and parcel of the Culture Clap ethos; to bring multiple rhythms, melodies and harmonies together in creation of something of which anyone can partake.
