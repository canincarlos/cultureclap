# Welcome to Culture Clap (üçÉ,üß™) 

**My name is Canin Carlos** a.k.a. [Culture Clap](https://www.cultureclap.com)

Currently I'm building my resume via [DreamFreely Labs](//www.dreamfreely.xyz) and applying for jobs!!

Though the highlight is the docker-compose file which creates the environment to deploy Postgres/Django/React applications via Docker.

I got scripts to work that load both SciPy and Xvfb for headless Selenium web-scraping.

[Rebel Coding](//rebelcoding.com) is a *Learn to Code* curriculum via [@RebelCoding](//www.github.com/RebelCoding).

[idioke](//www.idioke.com) is a web and phone app on deck behind the scenes of a splash page :)

My apologies as the server for these personal projects is currently down until approximately Saturday ...
