# The Projects
There are three primary projects, idioke, Rebel Coding & Comuna Colombia.

Each are meant to be a step towards another, and beyond, for participants. Based out of Colombia, acquisition and mastery of the English language is very important; idioke makes this knowledge more accessible, using music.

Rebel Coding takes learners to the next step of acquiring digital skills to ply on the global market. While Comuna Colombia exists to be a pre-existing commercial, cultural and conversation bridge between Colombia and the world at large.

## Revenue Streams and Tributaries
Each project (rebel coding, idioke & comuna colombia) have either enacted plans for revenue, or are taking on revenue. Rebel Coding requires additional software be deployed, at the expense of time and planning; while Comuna Colombia awaits only the conclusion of this first drop.

Rebel Coding & idioke will continue paying me for my time at an hourly rate. Comuna Colombia will pay DreamFreely Labs 10% of gross revenue to pay for administration costs. The remainder of the monies will be distributed to indigenous individuals, and communities, to purchase food, clothes and shelter; and nothing more, save for school or medical supplies.
