Tools to learn to open-source tools and languages.

Why teaching? I haven't worked for any big corporations, I didn't go to school for computer science ... why would I try and teach this information ?

Because I've been playing with it for over 20 years ... I have worked in the industry professionally and I continue to build and maintain applications. As well, I've been teaching for the past two years.

I love teaching, and I'm not horrible at it ... ergo, we begin with the email course, which is a two week survey of the topics we cover in the four-week Crash Course.

And lastly, we provide Rebel Labs, to enable students shell access to a server through a browser.
