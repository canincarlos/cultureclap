## RCE6: The Full-Stack

First off, congrats on getting this far!

We've gone through quite a bit of content rather quickly!!

Maybe you've even got your own website running on Github by now ?!?

Just as we started this course with a brief history of computers, I would like to end this first section with a brief history of the Internet ...

### The Brief History of the Internet

Thank you to the Internet Society for providing the more in-depth summation from which much of this information is gleaned.

Telephones and radios were cool, but they relied on circuits.

**What if you could send packets of information ?**

Attempting to answer this question ARPANET, or Advanced Research Project Agency Network, was born; and in 1969 the first host computer was connected at the University of California Los Angeles.

A second node was installed at the Stanford Research Institute, and soon other nodes we added as well.

In 1972 the technology now known as email, or electronic mail, was introduced and the internet as we know it today was well on it’s way out of infancy!

ARPANET was a closed system, mostly used by university researchers and their corporate counterparts.

It was a network small enough to be nearly “error-proof”; as in packets were rarely, if ever, dropped. Each node architected to specific, if not the exact same, specifications as each other.

Thus Bob Kahn was inspired to create a protocol that would be more robust in an open-architecture environment, and so devised what would become known as the Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).

What’s your IP number?

Have you ever searched the question?

It’s like your computer’s address on the internet.

Except this address can change depending on where from you are connecting.


This is a simplified picture of what an internet packet looks like.

We have a source address, and a destination address; your computer’s IP address being the destination address or source address.

Servers are located on computers, attached to the internet, and have an IP address as well.

In-between sit a series of other computers that translate these numerical addresses into namespaces and URLs, uniform resource locators.

And so, when you visit a website, your computer sends out a request packet, that travels by a series of numerical addresses to a specified destination.

If you'd like to learn more about this adventure, here's an excellent video that goes a bit deeper.

### The Full-Stack

Let’s take a moment to reflect on what the "full-stack" actually is.

How does it all connect?

**If the full-stack were a restaurant:**

The **database** is our walk-in cooler, and deep freeze; holding all the data that changes, or the food that will be used to prepare meals for our guests & visitors.

The **server** is the kitchen; using the contents of the cooler/freezer to fulfill our data requests, or orders, as made by the client …

And the **client** is more like the waitstaff; taking the orders, and completing requests for our users and visitors.

If you still have confusion about this analogy, [don’t hesitate to ask in the Discord!](https://discord.gg/bwMRRbs "https://discord.gg/bwMRRbs")

Though now let’s review each component further in-depth.

And now for our illustrious link below ...
