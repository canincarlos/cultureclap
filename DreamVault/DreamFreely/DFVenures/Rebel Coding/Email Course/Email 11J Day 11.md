Getting a job is more dependent on your network than your immediate know-how; and there are a growing number of entry-level access points. From internships to freelancing, your options are as broad as your imagination; and your network.

So the first job is to start building out your network. There a variety of communities focusing on all areas and frameworks. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [CareerKarma](https://careerkarma.com/), [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/) are a few examples.

Next up, you need your resume. Honestly, I'm not going to pretend I'm a professional, or even successful in this specific area. Though I've had the fortune to receive a few nifty templates, which I now pass on to you.

[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OY7-D4dYSZGOeJw5dOgRLQow6wrFLJnkgmEMBML_eNs/edit?usp=sharing) - this is my personal resume. The idea is to make a billboard, with enticements to keep the reader reading, while inspiring them to continue the conversation. 

Admittedly, this area is not my expertise, and if you need help, I encourage you to reach out to other for their feedback on your resume ... it's a great way to expand your network, asking for help :)

And finally, finding jobs, if you're from an under-represented community, definitely check out [DiversityTechCo](https://www.diversifytech.co/)! Veni is vetting all of the listings and making sure they are aligned with what our communities deserve!

Lastly, be you, be authentic. This is the most assured way to find a place where you'll be able to grow in a healthy and sustainable way, which is the least that you deserve!
