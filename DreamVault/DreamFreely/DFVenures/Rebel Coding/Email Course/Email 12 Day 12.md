## RCE12: Thank you,

Thank you for taking a chance on this collection of information, I do hope it has been accessible and helpful.

It would be fantastic to hear any feedback you might have to offer as well.

Regardless, below is a brief overview of the main-points we covered. Respect that you will be searching resources for the simplest question all the days and nights of your time in technology. The idea is to continually refine your comprehension of the system, so when something breaks, you improve your context for possible solutions.

  

### Complete overview of everything:

#### HTML, CSS and Javascript.

If we're building a house HTML are the walls, floors, and door/window frames. CSS are the aesthetics, wall colors and is gaining ground on aspects of interactivity. Which introduces us to JavaScripts role, proving the plumbing and electrical to our house.

To reverse course and follow a data packet, it is first retrieved/received by JavaScript and brought into what we later learn is the client structure. After being received it is labelled and directed into our HTML/CSS structure, where our CSS tells our elements their color shape. Our HTML tells our element where in our framework it is to reside.

#### Python web scrapers

We learned Python as an extension of our base coding knowledge. If you'd like to continue practicing, please join our Discord Community.

#### Database, Server and Client

A full-stack application is built around the following three entities:

The database to store our information, the server to gather, analyze and deliver our information, and finally our client to display our information.

#### Server, Development and Deployment

Though a code sitting on a computer needs to be served, which is where Apache and Nginx arrive. Now that that is covered; we'll use a program like doctor to keep our development environment consistent across platforms. And to less the payload on the servers, we'll use a caching too to server frequently accessed data. Then lastly we'll look to programs like Kubernetes or Terraform to scale this entire ensemble of technologies.
