## RCE5: Python & Web Scrapers

What if you could automate processes in your building â€¦ but not just simple processes - intensive analysis and creation ?

Enter Python!

Python has access to systems level functionality allowing it to interact with the hardware in a larger variety of ways!

And though this is a bit more of a detailed explanation, compared to what we've already done; we'll still stay in the shallow end of the pool for writing our first web scraper.

This is merely an overview of a script available on Github, along with a few more links to learn more about working with Python using Virtual Environments.

Though now it is time for our inevitable link below ...

On Step Further: A list of Python resources -- ask Twitter and Reddit.

Hey y'all, I'm putting together a small survey course introducing web-development. And at the end of the section about Python, I'd like to put a small list of resources readers can access to learn more!

My primary introduction was Learn Python the Hard Way ... which I see is still around, but it's been quite sometime ...

(My survey course is designed for absolute beginners, so resource for beginners to moderately intermediate level would be super cool.)

Thank you!
