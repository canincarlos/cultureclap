## RCE11: How to NoCode

The options abound for no code opportunities. Wix, Webflow, Bubble and more. As well, there is a new option brewing, called 'low-code'; which allows for a minimal amount of coding. 

Wordpress is a good example of what could be considered a low-code option. One has access to make CSS-styling changes. Wordpress also grants user access to the complete code-base though, if you'd like.

Webflow is for creating web-applications using a point-and-click methodology. Bubble provides similar method for creating mobile applications. Both of these tools have matured considerably since their creation and there are a plethora of tutorials available to help you get started.

There are also plenty of non-traditional options; Notion is one example of an platform that is not directly intended for application creation, though can be used as such. As well, by using tools such as Zapier with other platforms (Airtable, Google Sheets and more), workflows can be created to automate behaviors. So when users enact certain actions, certain effects are manifest; thus accomplishing your end-goal without ever touching any code.
