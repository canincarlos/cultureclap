## RCE9: Linux & Deployment

So we've run through the full-stack ... and we know how an application works; but you'd be correct if you think it takes alot more than a single-server to manage applications such as Twitter, Facebook and Netflix.

We aren't going to dive deep but we do want to cover a few hotspots that allow such applications to "scale".

-   Cacheing
-   Dockers
-   Kubernetes

We'll also get into some firewall convos and a bit more, because, why not ?

And so returns our indomitable link below ...
