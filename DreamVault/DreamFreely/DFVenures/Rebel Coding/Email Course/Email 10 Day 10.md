## RCE10: Breather and Review

Wow, yea, we really covered a lot of information!

Great work! Hopefully you feel that you've got a solid overview of how web development works to create and sustain digital applications.

If you'd like one-on-one support, I encourage ya to check out the Crash Course. It's only $100, or find a group of friends, and roll through together!

Four-weeks, cohorts of four; we go through all of this material, during twice weekly one-hour Zoom group sessions. 

You also get 30 minutes of one-on-one time with me every week!!

We'll answer your specific questions and focus on how you can most efficiently get where you'd like to go.

But enough of this marketing material, we're takin' a bit of a break of the technical stuff today, though I've got some additional resourses for ya to check out if ya like.
