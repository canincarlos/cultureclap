## RCE2: Shell Commands and Github

About that Github account.

**_Caveat:_** _Github has open contracts with ICE; frustratingly enough they are also a monlithic presence in the open-source world. Hence the begrudging encouragement to get a Github account when beginning._

The real function being that it allows us to publish a web-page to the internet, acting as the _host_ of our files, and as a _server_ to serve those files (we'll dig further into these term later.)

In this way, we can share our creations with others right from the start.

#### Next let's run through some introductory shell commands.

If you are using a Mac, use Spotlight to search for the Terminal program. Open it up and begin following along; all of these instructions will work the same for you. If you are using Windows, I’m sorry, but we won’t delve into the differences Powershell employs. Rather I recommend you purchase a one month subscription to Rebel Labs, where you can use the Linux terminal provided.

_whoami_ & _pwd_ are two of the first commands one ought learn. Type each command into the terminal and press Enter.

But this is actually REALLY difficult to describe without images; and so I present to you a step-by step guide to starting your Github account, and making your first repository.
