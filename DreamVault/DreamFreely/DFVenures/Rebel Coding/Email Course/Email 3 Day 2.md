## RCE3: HTML & CSS

So now we're going to get started building our digital domicile!

**HTML & CSS** are the basic building blocks for most web-pages, and dare I say mobile applications. Earlier we compared building a webpage to building a house or similar structure; because the analogy works!

HTML determines the structural look of a web page, if the wire-frame was a blueprint, HTML is what makes it stand. 

HTML is the layout, walls, stairs, and open spaces for doors, windows, outlets, and the like. CSS is the paint colors, motifs and patterns that will decorate our structure, while also being able to influence structural aspects (think mobile designs).

> It should be noted that CSS's capabilities have expanded much further, and continue to grow!

HTML also introduces us to our first basic pattern in coding.

`<html><head></head><body></body></html>`

HTML uses tags, enclosed by arrows (<>), to contain information. Notice how each tag has an explicit beginning and end. **We gotta make sure we finish what we start!**
