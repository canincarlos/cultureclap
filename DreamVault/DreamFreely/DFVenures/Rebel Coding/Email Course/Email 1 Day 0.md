## Welcome to the Rebel Coding Email Course

I'm so excited you've chosen to take the plunge into the world of computer programming!

**Welcome to the beginning a long road;** whether you're passionate about programming, or not, the technology is always evolving; so stagnancy is not an option.

Remember, what I'm promising to provide is a solid foundation for computer programming; there are *so* many methods and aspects, one could likely never learn everything. Though what everyone should learn, is what we'll start with first.

All of the projects we will discuss, and use, are built on stable platforms. Because while the changing nature of technology is constant, there are ways to create stability as well.

This is one reason why many will often pick a framework, or topic, and stay the course to an approximation of expertise; it is a great path to employment. 

Though to be honest, that isn't our immediate concern here. Our immediate concern is to provide you, the reader, with as broad an overview of web development as possible. In doing so, introducing you to the basic skills needs to understand computer programming more fully.

While one needs to know the lay of the terrain before picking a place to build a home ... yes/no?

### The History of the Computer

Computers are a tool, and an evolution of the tools before them.

The abacus, and other archaic tools, were used to count and record; even writing is a technology, a tool. The computer has evolved into a combination of these technologies, and more!

From the abacus to the punch card, and finally to the Unix platform and the C language, which is where we will start our story.

Born out of a collaboration between research universities, government, and industry, at first the Unix program was too buggy to have any immediate applicability. It was discarded, only to be improved, and utilized, by a community of researchers.

Their trials and tribulations gave us the movement that continues with open-source software (and hardware) today, along with so much of technology's advancements!

#### Recent History

It was not so many years ago that Microsoft open-sourced much of their software. The company had been at odds with the open-source world for decades!

Consequentially, there are a few differences between the shell command set we will be using, and the notation used in Windows' Powershell environment. Due to the history of computing, there are *almost no differences* beween the shell command set we will be learning, and the shell command set used by Apple products.

While technology touches nearly every aspect of our lives; there are relatively few technologies operating beneath them all ...

### The First Steps

We start with learning about web development because it gets to the basics of everything the internet is about:

Creating a unique, individual package,or packet, and making it available to the world.

We'll learn HTML & CSS like learning how to frame (HTML), and decorate (CSS) a house; we'll explore JavaScript as a means of providing functionality (electrical & plumbing) to our digital creation. And lastly, we wade into Python as a means of building tools, automating and evolving our creations.

None of the aforementioned tools are restricted to the uses described above; rather this course itself is merely a tool to introduce each of these technologies.

For those wanting to interact with the course; I encourage y'all to [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/bwMRRbs "https://discord.gg/bwMRRbs"), while the first thing we're going to do is draw-up a wireframe ...

Essentially I want you to draw a picture, or a series of pictures, to show how you want your web site/application to look, for functionality, not aesthetics :)

> Wireframe image has been added!!!

Where do you think the menu should go? What's the content presentation like? What are the differences between desktop and mobile ??

This is where multiple pictures can be useful; and this is just a way for us to start thinking like programmers: how will people interact with our creations, and why ?

[Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/bwMRRbs "https://discord.gg/bwMRRbs"), and send us a copy of one of your wireframes ?

Thanks for checkin' out the course  ~
