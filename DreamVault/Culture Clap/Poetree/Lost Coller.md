# Song with beat
Normalized formlized, past off as a habit, 2 pills thrice daily
help to swallow the news, obits, breakthroughs; 
Today's tool ain't for the front-desk, no we brought
gasoline and matches to burn down a the building
then dance on the dirt, communing with the work.
put two truths together fusing a past to a present
future trajectory destined to shatter the rules,
re-write the patterns forging a proof
that there's more to life than dividends and duesq 


like the 500 hundred years wasn't enough, you got fight the distractions just to survive
